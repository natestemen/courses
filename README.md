# courses

A repo for my coursework as a phd student at the University of Waterloo in the applied math department, with a specialization in quantum information.

So far I've mostly taken courses pretty seriously, but I know grades during a PhD basically don't matter. For that reason I try not to spend crazy amounts of time on homeworks, but if I do, chances are it's because I'm fiddling with LaTeX, not doing homework. I've learned a lot of cool TeX things by doing my homework like drawing quantum circuit diagrams, plotting functions, and doing things with colors.
